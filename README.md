Access transactions, download statements, get balances...all the things you
expect from the online account access at Belgrade State Bank.

This would likely work with other banks using the same Fiserv backend, but
that would require access to online banking from some other bank!

I'm guessing that any bank whose online account access is through a
`secureinternetbank.com` address is using a similar backend and this code
could easily be modified to work with it.

If you've got such a bank, [create an issue](https://github.com/dmwyatt/makebank/issues) and we'll talk about it!
